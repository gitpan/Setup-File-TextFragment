DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  setup_text_fragment(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Insert/delete text fragment in a file.

    On do, will insert fragment to file (or delete, if "should_exist" is set
    to false). On undo, will restore old file.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or not a regular file (directory
    and symlink included).

    Fixed state: file exists, fragment already exists and with the same
    content (if "should_exist" is true) or fragment already does not exist
    (if "should_exist" is false).

    Fixable state: file exists, fragment doesn't exist or payload is not the
    same (if "should_exist" is true) or fragment still exists (if
    "should_exist" is false).

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   attrs => *hash*

        Fragment attributes (only for inserting new fragment), passed to
        Text::Fragment.

    *   should_exist => *bool* (default: 1)

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
