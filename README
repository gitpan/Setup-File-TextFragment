NAME
    Setup::File::TextFragment - Insert/delete text fragment in a file, with
    undo support

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Setup::File::TextFragment (from
    Perl distribution Setup-File-TextFragment), released on 2014-05-17.

FUNCTIONS
  setup_text_fragment(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Insert/delete text fragment in a file.

    On do, will insert fragment to file (or delete, if "should_exist" is set
    to false). On undo, will restore old file.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or not a regular file (directory
    and symlink included).

    Fixed state: file exists, fragment already exists and with the same
    content (if "should_exist" is true) or fragment already does not exist
    (if "should_exist" is false).

    Fixable state: file exists, fragment doesn't exist or payload is not the
    same (if "should_exist" is true) or fragment still exists (if
    "should_exist" is false).

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   attrs => *hash*

        Fragment attributes (only for inserting new fragment), passed to
        Text::Fragment.

    *   id* => *str*

    *   payload* => *str*

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
